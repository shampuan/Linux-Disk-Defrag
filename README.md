# Linux-Disk-Defrag
Ext4 partisyonları için defragmenter uygulaması


This program is a defragger application for Linux systems using mechanical HDDs. Its purpose is to improve performance in systems that still use HDDs. It is particularly useful in server workstations. Although EXT file systems are often described as free of fragmentation, they actually experience fragmentation, providing performance improvements of up to 30 percent, especially in cases of severe fragmentation. 

The program doesn't let you defragment your SSDs. It also tells you that it's not possible on non-EXTFS disk structures like SWAP and NTFS.
